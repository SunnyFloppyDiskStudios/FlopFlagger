# FlopFlagger
### The neatest little Roblox FastFlag manager for macOS!

**WARNING:** Abusing FastFlags in games to get an unfair advantage is VERY BAD and will GET YOU BANNED! DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
**DISCLAIMER:** Roblox is slowly phasing out fastflags. It is highly likely that in the coming months FlopFlagger will become useless. Additionally, because im realllly bad at futureproofing, the code contains like no comments whatsoever and the codebase is a mess to work on. So, unlikely that I would even update it if Roblox decided not to phase out FastFlags.

Built with SwiftUI. Manage client flags with ease, easy to use GUI. Save your favourite presets and even share them.
