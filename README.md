# FlopFlagger
### The neatest little Roblox FastFlag manager for macOS!
Built from the ground up, with SwiftUI, for simplicity and ease of use.

Manage client flags with ease, using clear GUI and without hiding anything.

Save your favourite presets, so you can always access features when you need them.

Share presets with others, so they can also experience beta features for themselves.
